## EXPERIENCE

**Distributed System 6.824 Project**   2022.3-2022.7

Developed MapReduce, Raft and a kv storage system taking advantages of the goruntines and GC of Go.	

**First Place of Qualcomm AI Application Development Competition-Emotion Detection Track**   2021.3-2021.8

Implemented a “tiktok” like short video application, and design a recommendation algorithm based on the emotion detection technics. We smoothly combine the emotion detection and video recommendation to provide a better experience of the individualized recommended service. 	

**The best Skill Award in Unique hackday, Unique Studio**  2021.6-2021.6

Use Qt to provide users a training UI where they can tune the hyperparameters of the training process developed in a 24 hours extreme programming competition. And then our system will automatically train the DNN model. Users can visually watch their training performance over a group of the hyperparameters through the number of planes their AI driven by the model had crashed.	

**Computer System Architecture Course Project: PA** 2020.2-2020.3

Implemented x86 instructions using C and build a simple file system. Finally, we can run a traditionally Chinese video game “The Legend of Sword and Fairy” on the n86 (a subset of x86) simulator.

**Software Engineer, EMUI, Huawei**   2019.3-2019.5

Designed and implemented a startup UI of "Using your phone healthily". When users first click into this feature, they will get a straightforward “healthy score” of their using phone behavior which would encourage people to open this module to optimize their phone-using habits.	

## PAPERS

**Xstream: A Flexible, Adaptive Video Transformer for Privacy-Preserving Video Stream Analytics**  In Submission

Designed a SQL-like language to provide an interface for users to describe their privacy needs on video streams. XStream would automatically generate efficient DAG scheme for privacy protection and output the privacy-preserving video streams.

**DynaQ：Learning for Adaptive Video Stream Analytics with Dynamic Quality of Experience**  In Submission

We design a system in the edge to handle users’ inference tasks. The system profiles network condition (latency, bandwidth) to choose an optimal DNN model to improve QoE.
